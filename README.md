## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.  There are three main categories of Machine Learning:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning (not taught in this class)

### Supervised Learning
In Supervised Learning, the training set that is fed into the algorithm  includes the desired solutions, called *labels*. There are two types of supervised learning tasks:
* Classification: Purpose is to predict a label, or a discrete class label output.
* Regression: Purpose is to predict a quanitty, or predicting a continuous quantity output.

Examples of Supervised Learning covered in this project are:
* [K-Nearest_Neighbors](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/KNN)
* [Logistic_Regression](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Logistic_Regression)
* [Linear_Regression](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Linear_Regression)
* [Gradient_Descent](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Gradient_Descent)
* [Decision_Trees](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Decision_Tree)
* [Perceptron](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Perceptron)
* [Multilayer_Perceptron](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Multilayer_Perceptron)
* Ensemble_Methods

  - [Random_Forest](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/Ensemble_Methods/Ensemble_Random_Forest.ipynb)

### Unsupervised Learning
In an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, the training data is *unlabeled*. It is used to identify patterns in data sets containing the unclassified or unlabeled datapoints. It thus identifies the patterns on its own.

Examples of Unsupervised Learning covered in this project are:
* [KMeans](https://github.com/maxwell-boozer/Data_4319_ML/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning/KMeans)
