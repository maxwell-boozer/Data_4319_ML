An Ensemble Learning algorithm operates on the principle of aggregated predictions of a group of predictors. A group of predictors is called an *ensemble*, which gives this technique its name.

In Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning will generate the final model from a majority vote if its a classification task, or an average for a regression task.

## Types of Ensemble Learning

There are different techniques for ensemble learning, but the two we will focus on in this project are **Bagging** and **Random Forests**

A description of each method can be found in their respective Jupyter notebook.
